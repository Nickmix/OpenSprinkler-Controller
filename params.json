Designed to allow manual control, program management (view, edit, delete and add), initiate a run-once program, view status, adjust rain delay, and view logs.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n+ You first need a working OpenSprinkler setup \r\n\r\n+ Install prerequisites as needed (example for Debian)\r\n  + ```apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5``` \r\n\r\n+ Download the files\r\n  + ```git clone https://github.com/salbahra/OpenSprinkler-Controller.git```\r\n  + ```mv opensprinkler-controller/sprinklers /var/```\r\n  + ```mv opensprinkler-controller/www/sprinklers /var/www/```\r\n\r\n+ Fill in the OpenSprinkler local IP, password and other settings.\r\n  + ```nano /var/www/sprinklers/config.php```\r\n\r\n+ Add the poller to crontab every 1 minute for logging:\r\n  + ```* * * * *     /usr/bin/php /var/sprinklers/SprinklerWatcher.php >/dev/null 2>&1```\r\n\r\n+ Add a user to the configuration.
